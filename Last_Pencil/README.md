This is the *Last Pencil (Python)* project I made myself.


<p>Playing with friends is pure fun but getting ahead of them is even more enjoyable. Invite a friend to play the Last Pencil, a game where you decide who wins.Â In this project, your opponent is a computer that is an expert in the game. But it's up to you to choose who wins.</p>
